# Final-Project

This function is relatively simple to run and understand. Just simply run the function eulerApprox. Note that eulerApprox requires that eulerData.csv is downloaded.
When you run the function, a figure will appear with a red graph and some buttons. Each position of the scroll bar shows a different graph.
This figure is meant to visually explain the concept of Euler's Method, which is a simple approximation used in caclulus. This will be explained more when you press the button 'Step Size'.
